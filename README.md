# nbtdoc
nbtdoc is a schema format for describing an NBT format. The format of nbtdocs are a lot like Rust's structs. 
This library is based on [nbtdoc_rs](https://github.com/MrYurihi/nbtdoc-rs]) which is considered the "source" library for the format, and any library wishing to parse nbtdocs should use that library as a reference implementation.
